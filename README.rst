SmartAnthill
============

`SmartAnthill <http://smartanthill.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ is an
intelligent micro-oriented networked system. It opens the doors for people
that not familiar with electronics and micro-controller programming, but early
had dream to use it. The main goal of SmartAnthill is to destroy the wall
between usual user and hardware world. Thanks to this system we can combine
the independent micro-devices or micro-based networks into general
`SmartAnthill Network <http://smartanthill.readthedocs.org/en/latest/specification/network/index.html>`_.

You do not need to learn micro-programming languages, you do not need to install
any `IDE <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>`_
or `Toolchain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain>`_. All you need is to
connect micro-device to SmartAnthill, to select capabilities that device should
have and "train it" to behave as the network device.
