[SmartAnthill](http://smartanthill.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is an
intelligent micro-oriented networked system. It opens
the doors for people that not familiar with electronics and micro-controller
programming, but early had dream to use it. The main goal of SmartAnthill is to
destroy the wall between usual user and hardware world. Thanks to this
system we can combine the independent micro-devices or micro-based networks
into general [SmartAnthill Network](http://smartanthill.readthedocs.org/en/latest/specification/network/index.html).

You do not need to learn micro-programming languages, you do not need to install
any [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
or [Toolchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain). All you need is to
connect micro-device to SmartAnthill, to select capabilities that device should
have and "train it" to behave as the network device.
