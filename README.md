[SmartAnthill](http://smartanthill.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is an
intelligent micro-oriented networking system. It opens the door for people
that are not familiar with electronics and micro-controller programming, but
earlier had dream to use it. The main goal of SmartAnthill is to destroy the
wall between usual user and hardware world. Thanks to this system we can
combine the independent micro-devices or micro-based networks into general
[SmartAnthill Network](http://smartanthill.readthedocs.org/en/latest/specification/network/index.html).

You do not need to learn micro-programming languages, you do not need to install
any [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
or [Toolchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain). All you need is to
connect micro-device to SmartAnthill, to select capabilities that device should
have and "train it" to behave as the network device.
